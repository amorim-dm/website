We often hear people say we should save money, and thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that. All we want is healthy financial health and good quality of life. However, it may not be the most financially clever decision you can make.

If you are managing your money to achieve a better financial condition, then saving is not your go-to strategy. Here are a few reasons why you should invest your money.

## Inflation makes you lose buying power

Simply, inflation refers to a continuous and widespread increase in prices in an economy. It means, for example, that a product you could buy for $100 would be worth $101 the next month (if inflation were to be at 1%).

Unless your money beats inflation, you will be losing buying power because you will have the same amount of money for an increasing living cost.

Investments, however, can be indexed to inflation, preventing your assets from losing value over the years.

## Passive income

Investments can also give you a passive income stream, and it can be enough to live off, depending on the size of your investment. You can also make reinvestments to increase your future revenue substantially.

Savings, on the other hand, pay little in interest. Therefore, it is impossible to live off of its earnings.

## Compound interest

Reinvesting your money can be a powerful tool to increase your wealth due to compound interest.

Take, for example, an investment that pays 5% annually. If you reinvest your earnings, they will also yield at a 5% rate, and your money will grow exponentially. If you invest $100, it will yield $5 annually. If you reinvest those $5, you will earn $5.25 the next year and so on.

Here's a table for reference, starting with $1000.

| Year | Money     | Earnings  |
| ---- | --------- | --------- |
| 2020 | $ 1050    | $ 50      |
| 2030 | $ 1628.89 | $ 628.89  |
| 2040 | $ 2653.29 | $ 1653.29 |
| 2050 | $ 4321.94 | $ 3321.94 |
| 2060 | $ 7039.98 | $ 6039.98 |

In the example above, we start with only $1000 but imagine large amounts of money and higher earning rates. The results would be even more expressive.

## Conclusion

There are certainly other reasons why investing is better than saving. However, I hope those reasons are already good enough to point this out and introduce you gently to the investment world. See you later!
