Hi, there!

My name is Gustavo and this is the first post of my blog. I would like to talk a little about myself so you can know me a little better.

At the time of this writing, I am 18 years old and I live in Brazil. I’ve just finished high school and I am on my way to college soon. I like coding - a lot actually - and this website is my personal portfolio. I started coding at the end of 2019 - 15 to 16 years old - so I’m relatively new to this crazy yet wonderful universe.

The first language I learned was Java. I then moved to Python and now I’m mostly using Javascript/Typescript for Full-Stack Development. I’m enjoying a lot doing Web Development with NextJs a.k.a the Web SDK. I also have some experience with C++/C# because I was interested in Game Development (with Unity) for a while.

I’ve worked on a few projects over the past years - you can go check the <Link href="/#projects">home page</Link> to see a few of them.

I’ve decided to create this blog because I think writing is an important process of learning and it also has numerous benefits for the mind and body. This will be the space where I’ll post a variety of content whenever I feel like doing so.
I would also like to notice I’ve decided to monetize this blog via AdSense so I can save up some money to help my parents pay for my college - I’ll only put 2 ads max per post so it won’t be so polluted. I hope you can understand this decision.

That's it, guys. New posts will be coming up soon. I’ll also add a comment section to hear feedback from you as well. See ya soon!
